# Legitimate interests assessment

ICO guidance requires a three part legitimate interests assessment: identify a legitimate interest, show processing is necessary for that interest, and balance it against the individual’s interests, rights, and freedoms.

The guidance notes that necessity means a targeted, proportionate way to achieve the interest; if a less intrusive option works, legitimate interests may not apply.

Organisations should record the assessment and keep it under review, especially when context or risks change.
