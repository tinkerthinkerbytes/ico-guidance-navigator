# Consent requirements

ICO guidance says consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, obtained via clear affirmative action. Pre-ticked boxes or inactivity do not count.

People must be able to withdraw consent easily at any time, and withdrawal must be honoured promptly without detriment.

Records of consent should capture who, when, how, and what was communicated, enabling demonstration of valid consent if challenged.
