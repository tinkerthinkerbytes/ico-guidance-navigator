# Accountability and record-keeping

The ICO highlights accountability as a core principle: controllers must be able to demonstrate compliance, not just claim it.

Records of processing activities should describe purposes, lawful basis, categories of data and recipients, retention schedules, and safeguards such as Article 9 conditions where relevant.

Regular reviews and audits of these records are recommended to ensure they stay accurate and reflect current processing operations.
