# Data protection impact assessments

ICO guidance states a DPIA is mandatory for processing likely to result in high risk, such as large-scale monitoring, use of special category data, or innovative technologies.

The DPIA should describe processing, assess necessity and proportionality, evaluate risks to individuals, and set out measures to mitigate those risks.

If high risk remains and cannot be mitigated, controllers should consult the ICO before proceeding.
