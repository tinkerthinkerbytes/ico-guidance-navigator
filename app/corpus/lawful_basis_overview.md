# Lawful basis overview

The ICO states that organisations must identify and document at least one lawful basis before processing personal data. Using multiple bases for the same purpose is discouraged unless clearly justified.

The guidance emphasises that the chosen basis affects people’s rights, so it must be selected based on the purpose, not convenience or likelihood of consent.

Controllers should review their lawful basis if purposes change, updating records and privacy information accordingly.
