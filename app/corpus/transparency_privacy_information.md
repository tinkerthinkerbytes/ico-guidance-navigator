# Transparency and privacy information

ICO guidance states that controllers must provide privacy information in a concise, transparent, intelligible, and easily accessible form using clear language.

Privacy notices should explain the lawful basis, purposes, recipients, retention periods, and rights, and should be provided at the time of data collection or within a reasonable period when data is obtained indirectly.

When purposes or lawful basis change, notices should be updated and individuals informed where appropriate.
