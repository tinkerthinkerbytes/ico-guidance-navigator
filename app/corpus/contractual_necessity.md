# Contractual necessity

The ICO explains that contractual necessity applies when processing is objectively necessary to deliver a contract with the individual or to take requested steps before entering a contract.

Processing that is merely useful for business objectives or optional features is not covered; organisations must be able to show the core contract cannot be fulfilled without the processing.

Transparency is required: privacy information should name the contract, the processing, and why it is necessary for that contract.
